# Sales Funnel Analytics
Track conversion rate of different sales stages using python, funnel analysis for a list of events.
 
## Objective
This project is a funnel analysis to calculate the number/percentage of users that perform each step, visualising the conversion down the funnel, and then visualized it by producing a stacked funnel plots.

## Brief Intro to Projects
Funnel analysis is critical in identifying bottlenecks at any point in the customer journey. Usually, there is a key event which generates revenue for the business. Maximising the number of people performing this action is thus to our best interest.
Users can have numerous significant drop-off points. Visualising these helps in deciding which area to focus on to maximise conversion from one point to another.

What stands out from the above plot is that not enough customers purchase an item. In addition, maybe we could also improve the amount of customers that held demo so that fewer people are lost at this stage.

We can also increase overall user activity and engagement, but at the end of the day if we have many users that explore the app but do not generate revenue for us we might have been focussing on the wrong area.

Tracking different team performance is also important, and thatâ€™s why I'm plotting stacked funnel plots that will allow us to make comparisons between conversions of different team cohorts.

Stacked funnel plots clearly shows that although most of the leads and opportunities are generated by marketing team but the conversion rate of channel team is higher than marketing team.

## Tools and Requirements:
* Python (using v3.7)
* Pandas: for data manipulation
* Plotly: for visualisations
